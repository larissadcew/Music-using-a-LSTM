# Music Generation using LSTM 🎶

A deep learning project that leverages Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks to generate music, creating melodies that mimic patterns in the training data.

---

## 🎼 Features
- **Sequence Prediction**: Uses LSTM to predict the next note in a sequence.
- **Music Composition**: Generates new music based on learned patterns.
- **MIDI Integration**: Processes and outputs music in MIDI format.

---

## ⚙️ Technologies Used
- **Python**: Core programming language.
- **TensorFlow/Keras**: Frameworks for deep learning.
- **MIDI Libraries**: For music processing.
