# 🎵 Music Generation Using LSTM  

This project explores the use of **Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)** networks, a type of recurrent neural network (RNN), for generating music sequences. By training on a dataset of musical notes, the model learns patterns and generates new compositions, mimicking the style of the training data.

## 🔍 What Does This Project Do?  

This project leverages **deep learning** to create a system that generates music by:  
- Training an LSTM model on sequences of musical data. 🎼  
- Learning patterns and dependencies in musical compositions. 🎹  
- Producing novel music sequences as output, capturing the structure and style of the dataset. 🎶

## 🛠️ Technologies Used  

### 1. **LSTM Networks**  
- **Sequential Data Processing**: Designed to handle time-dependent data like music sequences.  
- **Memory Cells**: Retain relevant information over long time steps, crucial for capturing musical patterns.  

### 2. **TensorFlow/Keras**  
- Framework for constructing and training the LSTM network.  
- Provides tools for sequence processing, model optimization, and loss computation.  

### 3. **MIDI Files Processing**  
- Musical data is extracted, processed, and converted into a format suitable for LSTM training.  
- Libraries like **music21** are used for handling MIDI files.  

### 4. **NumPy and Pandas**  
- Facilitate numerical computations and preprocessing tasks.

## 🔧 How It Works  

### 1. Dataset  
The model is trained on a collection of **MIDI files**. These files are converted into sequences of notes or chords, representing the music as numerical data.  

### 2. Preprocessing  
- **Encoding Notes**: Convert musical notes and chords into numerical representations.  
- **Sequence Creation**: Split the data into overlapping sequences to train the LSTM.  
- **Normalization**: Scale values to a range suitable for neural network training.  

### 3. Model Architecture  
- **Input Layer**: Accepts sequences of encoded notes.  
- **LSTM Layers**: Capture temporal dependencies and patterns in the sequences.  
- **Dropout Layers**: Prevent overfitting by randomly disabling neurons during training.  
- **Dense Layer with Softmax**: Predicts the next note or chord in the sequence.  

### 4. Training  
- **Loss Function**: Categorical cross-entropy measures the difference between predicted and actual notes.  
- **Optimizer**: Adam optimizer adjusts the model's weights for better predictions.  
- **Epochs**: Model is trained over multiple epochs to refine its understanding of musical patterns.  

### 5. Music Generation  
- **Seed Sequence**: The model takes an initial sequence of notes as input.  
- **Prediction**: The trained LSTM predicts the next note, appending it to the sequence iteratively to generate a complete composition.

## 📊 Performance  

- **Training Accuracy**: Improves steadily as the model learns patterns in the data.  
- **Generated Music**: Produces coherent sequences that mimic the style of the training set.  
- **Limitations**: May occasionally generate repetitive or less structured sequences, depending on the diversity of the dataset.
